To install Neovim -> https://neovim.io/ 

or better with brew install neovim.

cd into ~/.config then ls and cd to it. 

moreover you can copy my setup or take ideas from plugins. 

It is mostly setup to use gopls and Go Programming Language. Although im slowly adding more support and tmux when I get used to it.

Cheers!
